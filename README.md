# E3SM Performance Data 

This repository serves as a data store for performance data from E3SM benchmarks and kernels.

This is unstructured by design and allows free-form raw data from sub-model and benchmark runs for longitudinal tracking. In that sense, it differs from [PACE](https://pace.ornl.gov), the structured automated performance database for E3SM.
