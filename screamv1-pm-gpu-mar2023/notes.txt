The pm-gpu runs in se58-mar9 are from a scream repo of March9th, but do have some minor changes in the module versions on the machine (that are going into E3SM).

It effectively has these changes:
https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM/pull/5533

/global/cfs/cdirs/e3sm/ndk/repos/se59-mar13-pm-module-updateMar2023
The git hash: 4934926240

The two cases noted here:

This is a 512-node case that does not have the minor module version update to show perf is about the same

These cases were run March 9,10,11 -- and I think shortly after this, NERSC made a change that drastically affects
performance, but was meant to ward off frequent NODE_FAILS.  I have a 384 node case as well, but it hit NODE_FAIL
at the end of the run and does not have detailed timing data. More recent 384-node runs did complete without
NODE_FAIL, but were much slower -- just helping NERSC debug the issue.  NERSC hopes to have the CACHE MONITOR
env variable back to normal after next machine maintenance which should be soon.
